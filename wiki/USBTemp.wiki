USBTemp measures the temperature and connects via USB to your computer.

= Introduction =
USBTemp provides a thermometer. It is based on the DS18S20 digital thermometers. In addition, the thermometer connects to an USB port - you can read the temperature using a commandline tool. In combination with RRDTool you can easily create temperature graphs:

This is a live graph of the temperature in Kaiserslautern, Germany - at least if my server at home is up and running.

= Features =

At this time, USBTemp provides these features:
  * Attaches to USB
  * Based on an ATMega168 (although an ATMega8 should work also)
  * No SMD components
  * Simple commandline tool for querying the sensors
  * Support for five DS18S20 temperature sensors (extensible)
  * Parasite-power mode for the DS18S20 - an 2-wire cable is sufficient to connect all sensors

= Download =
The current version can be downloaded from the "Download" page. The tarball contains the firmware, the host software and the schematic.

= Hardware =
The hardware consists of an ATMega168, the DS18S20 temperature sensors and some support elements. It is described on the USBTempHardware page.

= Software =
The host software uses libusb to connect to the hardware. You can query the device for available temperature sensors:
{{{
$ ./usbtemp sensors
2 sensor(s) found, querying
sensor 0: ID 9F17A5010800 type: (DS18S20)
sensor 1: ID B46865010800 type: (DS18S20)
}}}
The IDs are the actual unique hardware IDs of the DS18S20 sensors. Afterwards you can use the ID to query a sensor:
{{{
/usbtemp temp B46865010800
searching sensor with id B46865010800 - using sensor handle 1
reading sensor 1 (Â°C): +1.1875
}}}
If you want to use the raw temperature value in a script, simply discard stderr:
{{{
$ ./usbtemp temp B46865010800 2>/dev/null
+1.0000
}}}

The host software only depends on libusb and has been tested on Linux and Mac systems. With libusb-win32 it should be possible to compile it on Windows as well - but this is currently untested.

The microcontroller firmware uses several libraries:
  * The AVR-USB software-only USB driver from [http://obdev.at/products/avrusb/index.html Objective Development]
  * The DS18X20 code example of [http://www.siwawi.arubi.uni-kl.de/avr_projects/tempsensor/index.html Martin Thomas] which in turn uses code of Peter Fleury (uart-library) and Colin O'Flynn (CRC-code).
